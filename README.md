# <div align="center">C++ OpenStreetMap parser</div>

This is a very basic C++ project created as an assignment for the course CS29202 ( Software Engineering Lab ).

1. Ensure you have cmake and g++.
2. Clone the Project.
3. In the project root directory, run the command `cmake --build build/`. This will create a build directory in your project folder.
4. Put the OSM file in the build folder. Ensure that the file name is `map.osm`.
5. Run the executable by running the command `./OSMKGP` in the build directory.
